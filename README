nodeapi is a simple, low-code API and was created as a submission 
for the Bendigo Bank IBL 2021 Tech Challenge as part of the 
application process. 

The API has minimal use and stands as a proof of concept for a 
fully functional NodeJS API. The API is designed to return the name,
version number and git hash of the latest git push. 

The endpoint is /health and the port number is 8000.

To run the API, type the followinf into a docker-enabled 
command line: 

    docker run -dp 8000:8000 garethtjones/nodeapi
