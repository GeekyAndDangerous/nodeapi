nodeapi is a simple, low-code API and was created as a submission 
for the Bendigo Bank IBL 2021 Tech Challenge as part of the 
application process. 

The API has minimal use and stands as a proof of concept for a 
fully functional NodeJS API. The API is designed to return the name,
version number and git hash of the latest git push in a simple text format 

The endpoint is /health and the port number is 8000.

This build assumes that your system houses an operational
version of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and that [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
is installed.

To run the API, type the following into your command line: 

    docker run -dp 8000:8000 garethtjones/nodeapi
